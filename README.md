The executive team at the bicycle retail company seeks a comprehensive Sales Dashboard to analyze sales activities from 2016 to 2018. This project aims to provide actionable insights into sales trends, revenue distribution, and key performance indicators across regions, stores, product categories, and brands. The dashboard will empower executives to make informed, data-driven decisions to drive business growth.

### Data Source
---
The data source, BikeStore.xlsx, is a spreadsheet file that contains sales and customer-related data for the Bike Store retail company. 

### Tools 
---
- SQL
- Excel
- Tableu
  
### Data Cleaning in Excel
---
During data cleaning, I conducted a quick review of the dataset to check for redundancies, missing data, or empty fields. All fields appeared to be complete, and the number of records was consistent across the dataset.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer questions such as:
- What is the overall revenue trend over the years?
- What are the monthly sales trends?
- Which states generate the most revenue?
- How does each store contribute to overall revenue?
- Which brands contribute the most to total revenue?
- Which product categories generate the most revenue?
- Who are the highest-value customers?
- Which sales representatives are performing best?

### Sales Analysis using excel
---
I have created several pivot tables and pivot charts in Excel to analyze revenue across different dimensions. These charts provide a clear visualization of key metrics and trends, helping to gain insights into the company’s sales performance. The following charts were created:
- Revenue per Year: Displays total revenue for each year, providing an overview of yearly performance trends.
- Revenue per Month: Breaks down revenue by month, allowing for an analysis of seasonal trends and monthly fluctuations.
- Revenue per State: Shows revenue distribution by state, identifying high-performing regions and areas for potential growth.
- Revenue per Store: Visualizes revenue across individual stores, helping to compare performance and assess store-specific success.
- Revenue per Brand: Highlights how different brands contribute to overall revenue, identifying top performers.
- Revenue per Product Category: Displays revenue by product category, providing insights into which types of products are most profitable.
- Revenue per Customer: Ranks customers based on their total revenue contribution, helping identify top customers and high-value accounts.
- Revenue per Sales Rep: Compares the performance of sales representatives, showing their impact on revenue generation.
These charts help to break down revenue data into actionable insights and support decision-making across different levels of the business.
