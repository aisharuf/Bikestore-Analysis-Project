### Data Cleaning in Excel
During data cleaning, I conducted a quick review of the dataset to check for redundancies, missing data, or empty fields. All fields appeared to be complete, and the number of records was consistent across the dataset.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer questions such as:
- What is the overall revenue trend over the years?
- What are the monthly sales trends?
- Which states generate the most revenue?
- How does each store contribute to overall revenue?
- Which brands contribute the most to total revenue?
- Which product categories generate the most revenue?
- Who are the highest-value customers?
- Which sales representatives are performing best?


### Sales Analysis using excel
I have created several pivot tables and pivot charts in Excel to analyze revenue across different dimensions. These charts provide a clear visualization of key metrics and trends, helping to gain insights into the company’s sales performance. The following charts were created:

- Revenue per Year: Displays total revenue for each year, providing an overview of yearly performance trends.
- Revenue per Month: Breaks down revenue by month, allowing for an analysis of seasonal trends and monthly fluctuations.
- Revenue per State: Shows revenue distribution by state, identifying high-performing regions and areas for potential growth.
- Revenue per Store: Visualizes revenue across individual stores, helping to compare performance and assess store-specific success.
- Revenue per Brand: Highlights how different brands contribute to overall revenue, identifying top performers.
- Revenue per Product Category: Displays revenue by product category, providing insights into which types of products are most profitable.
- Revenue per Customer: Ranks customers based on their total revenue contribution, helping identify top customers and high-value accounts.
- Revenue per Sales Rep: Compares the performance of sales representatives, showing their impact on revenue generation.
These charts help to break down revenue data into actionable insights and support decision-making across different levels of the business.
